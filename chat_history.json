The `isAdminPost` property in the `Event` type is a good start.\n5.  **UI/UX Considerations:** Clearly distinguish admin posts from user posts in the main feed using visual cues like badges or different styling.\n\nLet's focus on solidifying the admin role and securing the admin post creation process.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-21T15:32:40.701812"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement a secure admin authentication system that prevents regular users from accessing admin functionality.
